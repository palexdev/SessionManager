A simple plugin that allows to save the current session of the IDE.
<br/>
Open files will be stored by default in the .idea folder or in one of the fallback directories if that was not available
(can be either project directory or user.home directory), or in any other directory of your choice.
The saved JSON file is then used to restore the saved sessions at any time on any machine (given certain conditions
further explained below).
<br />
The plugin is very easy to use. Three new options are added in two places: in the Tools menu and in the Tabs
context menu. All of them have icons to easily distinguish them among the other options.
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Save Session</b>: this option allows you to save all the currently open tabs to a JSON file named `session-manager.json`,
        this name is hard-coded, and the plugin will always check for this file in the default directories when first initialized.
        The Session has four parameters: the name, the timestamp (in milliseconds), the description and the path. The latter ones are optional. When no path
        is specified the plugin will automatically use one of the default directories (.idea, project directory, user.home).
        As a developer, I suggest that you use the description wisely. I decided to add it because often I end up forgetting
        where I was and what I was doing, especially if I don't work on the project for some time. The plugin also saves the focused tab,
        so that when the session is restored, you will see the same tab opened before.
        <br />
        <b>Note on the save</b>: when the project or the IDE are closed, the plugin automatically saves the session with
        the name `AutoSave` (overwritten automatically every time).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Load Session</b>: the plugin has a Map in which sessions are stored. This option allows you to re-load one of those
        sessions previously saved.
        <br />
        There are two really important things to consider here:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The save action has no limit over the tabs it can record, BUT, the load action will "fail" to load them all if
                the IDE settings do not allow it, before restoring a big session make sure that the <b>Editor->General->Editor Tabs->Tabs Limit</b> setting is big enough.
            </li>
            <li>
                The save action allows you to record any open file, BUT, the intention of this plugin is to help you easily
                save/re-load project files. This means that files that which are external to the project will fail to open.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Load Session From File</b>: this action allows you to load any "session-manager.json" file into the plugin. Note that
        this action will not remove any other session already available, however since Sessions are stored like this
        Name->Session, Sessions with the same name will be overwritten!
        For this reason, even though the plugin doesn't impose any limit, it is <b>highly recommended</b> to store sessions in
        the .idea directory.
    </li>
</ol>
